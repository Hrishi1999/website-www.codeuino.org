Our project is an important part of Free Software Ecosystem. We work with other free projects to create high-quality solutions that span the entire software stack. While the many Codeuino contributors develop code, smash bugs, write documentation, and help users, the Foundation acts as a guiding hand in the process and provides resources and infrastructure. It steers releases, determines what software is officially part of the project, and acts as an official face of the Codeuino Project to the outside world, through it delegates most of its authority to specialized teams. Therefore, this guide would help you to become an integral part of the Community.</p><br>

                <p class="g-fs-16">To get started, the first step is to meet the community. We use Slack to communicate, and there the helpful community will guide you. Slack is an instant messaging service used by developers and users of Github. Slack uses chat rooms, where developers can join in and can talk about a particular topic. Codeuino has two types of chat rooms (channels) ‚Äì <strong>Meeting channel and General channel.</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Meeting chat room</strong> is related to a specific details and <strong>General chat room</strong> is related to general discussion topics like conferences, workshops and it is here where we welcome Newcomers and guide them. This is the main chat room of Codeuino. Everything related to conferences and off topics are discussed here.</p>
                <p class="g-fs-16 reduce">The list of all available chat rooms are available here - channel list. But before joining the community, here are few things that you should keep in mind.</p>

                            <p class="g-fs-16"><span>2. </span>It will be appreciated if your Github username and slack username is same which will make easier for all to identify you.</p>
                            <p class="g-fs-16"><span>3. </span>Do not mention users unrelated to a particular issue/question. This also means you should not mention the person that was last online. For example, mentioning someone on a Github issue will subscribe them to that issue, even if they don‚Äôt want to be a part of the discussion. However, mentioning someone is okay if they really need to see your message.</p>
                            <p class="g-fs-16"><span>4. </span>Don‚Äôt repeatedly mention people in an ongoing conversation.</p>
                            <p class="g-fs-16"><span>5. </span>You should ask someone before mentioning them.</p>

                <strong>Important !!</strong> You need to be logged in before you follow the issues link. They will give you a glimpse of what it‚Äôs like to work with us and what the workflow is like.<br><br>
                Also, for those who are new to Git and GitHub, our guidelines will help you throughout the process.
                <strong>Cloning our GitHub repository:-</strong> The git clone command is used to copy an existing Git repository from a server to the local machine. To clone our git repository follow these steps in your terminals:-<br><br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul id="points">

                        <p class="g-fs-16"><span>2. </span>copy and paste this code into your terminals for cloning our website code. Similarly just change the link to clone the other repositories <strong>git clone https://github.com/Codeuino/website-www.Codeuino.org.git</strong></p>
                        <p class="g-fs-16"><span>3. </span>Now pick an issue which isn‚Äôt assigned and which you would like to fix. Leave a comment that you would like to work on that particular issue. This way we don‚Äôt have multiple people working on the same issue at the same time. After this, you can start working on it.</p>
                        <p class="g-fs-16"><span>4. </span><strong>Caution:-</strong> You should never work on an issue without being assigned. Also take up the issue, only when you know what the problem is and how to solve it.</p>

                </ul>

            <div class="g-heading-v9 g-mb-30 steps-heading">
                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Step 4. Forking and Testing the Modifications</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="g-fs-16">You should first fork the repository by visiting the official repository of Codeuino and clicking on the button Fork. This step is needed only once.<br><br>
                <strong>Important !!</strong> It is important that you DO NOT make your changes on the master branch of your forked repository as you cannot have two pull requests using the same branch name. Therefore, if your fork‚Äôs master has been used in a pull request and you decide to work on a different issue you will have to branch eventually. Differently every new commit that you make on your master branch will get attached to the initial pull request and that will result in altering the purpose of that request.<br><br>
                You can create a branch per set of changes. To do that run:
                <strong>$ git checkout -b branchname</strong> where your branch name can be anything other than master. The scope is your forked repository. The branch name will be shown on pull request.Before pushing the pull request, you must test your changes with some concrete examples.<br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="g-heading-v9 g-mb-30 steps-heading">
                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Step 5. Sending a Pull Request</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="g-fs-16">Now that your commit has been sent to your fork, it is time to create a Pull Request. You can do this by accessing your fork on GitHub and clicking New Pull Request. <br><br>
            <strong>Note:-</strong> Comments are always welcomed, as the readability of the code becomes easy for the other developers. <br><br>
            <strong>Creating a Pull Request:-</strong> If you've forked a repository and made changes to the fork, you can ask that the upstream repository accept your changes by creating a pull request.<br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> To open a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull request. <br><br>
